# crop_type_prediction
Implementations of crop type segmentation using U-Net and Convolutional LSTM

The code for Training convolutional LSTM is adopted from :
1. https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/S4A : A Sentinel-2 multi-year, multi-country benchmark dataset for crop classification and segmentation with deep learning



2. https://github.com/Orion-AI-Lab/S4A-Models : Supplementary repo with DL experiments using the Sen4AgriNet dataset
